Pachinko Prefab Sizing Calculations

#Pachinko ball prefab sizing calculations

The pachinko ball prefab is a sphere with a radius of 0.5f. In real life, the ball is about 1.1cm in diameter.

0.5 unity units = 1.1cm

1 unity unit = 2.2cm

The pachinko ball prefab is used to simulate the ball in the pachinko game.

#Pachinko pin prefab sizing calculations

The pachinko pin prefab is a cylinder with a radius of 0.1f. In real life, the pin is about 1.1cm in diameter.

Pachinko cabinet dimensions:

Width: 27.5inches, 69.85cm, if the ball is .5 unity units, then the width is 34.925 unity units
Height: 55inches, 139.7cm, if the ball is .5 unity units, then the height is 69.85 unity units
depth: 18.5inches, 47cm, if the ball is .5 unity units, then the depth is 23.5 unity units
Most of the depth is for the back of the cabinet, the front of the cabinet is 13.97 unity units.
the playfield is 1 unity unit wide, and 1 unity unit deep.
this will hold the pins, bumpers, and spinners. The ball will travel down the playfield and into the scoring zone or into the gutter.
