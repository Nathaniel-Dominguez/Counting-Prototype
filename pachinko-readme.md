## üìñ Overview

This project evolved from Unity's "Counting Prototype" tutorial into a full-featured 3D pachinko simulation. It demonstrates advanced physics interactions, custom material properties, object pooling, and a comprehensive audio management system - all essential skills for game development.

### Key Features

- **Physics-Based Gameplay**: Experience realistic ball movement with precise collision detection using Unity's 3D physics system
- **Dual Camera System**: Toggle between a realistic glass-panel view and a clear gameplay view
- **Interactive Elements**: Encounter dynamic bumpers, spinners, and scoring pockets that respond to ball impacts
- **Visual Effects**: Enjoy particle effects, dynamic lighting, and material animations that provide satisfying feedback
- **Audio Design**: Immerse yourself in spatial audio with adaptive music intensity based on gameplay
- **Optimized Performance**: Play smoothly thanks to efficient object pooling and physics layer management

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Unity 2022.3 LTS or newer
- Basic understanding of Unity's interface

### Setup

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/unity-pachinko.git`
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Open the main scene in `Assets/Scenes/PachinkoMachine.unity`
4. Press Play to test the game in the editor

## üéØ How to Play

1. **Launch Balls**: Hold and release the spacebar to launch balls (hold longer for more power)
2. **Toggle View**: Press 'V' to switch between glass-on and glass-off views
3. **Objective**: Score points by getting balls into the scoring pockets
4. **Game End**: The game ends when you run out of balls
